# Spring JPA Example

Spring REST API with MySQL database connection JPA via.

This project does not have the complete correct structure because I will upload the complete project with the mapping to DTO in the future.

Complete the properties file with your database credentials:

````
spring.datasource.jdbc-url = jdbc:mysql://database_url/database_name
spring.datasource.username = database_username
spring.datasource.password = database_password
````
